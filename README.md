# Solving Boolean SAT Problem using Groverâ€™s Algorithm

Solve k-SAT problem with grover's algorithm in quantum computer using qiskit
- Created own *Oracle* based on given equation and displayed its circuit
- Using *Phase Estimation* and *Inverse QFT* to find the number of solutions **m** of given equation
- Applying Grover for *l* iteration where *l* is given by
$$l = \left \lfloor \left ( \frac{\pi }{2\cos^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{2^{n}-m}{2^{n}}}} -1\right )/2 \right \rceil$$
where *n = number of variables*
- Simulating final circuit in *Qasm Simulator* and *StateVector Simulator*
- Showing Histogram and printing StateVector

# REQUIREMENTS
- using pipenv
```bash
pipenv install
```

# Usage/Examples
### Problem Statement [ðŸ”—](https://app.simplenote.com/p/Pbbh5y)
Frank wants to throw a dinner party to celebrate Alice and Bobâ€™s engagement. He is also considering inviting their mutual friends Charles, Dave and Eve. However, he is aware that Charles will come to the party only if Dave comes without Eve. Frank wants to know what possible combinations of invitations he can write for his friends Alice, Bob, Charles, Dave and Eve.

Help Frank calculate all the possible combinations using Groverâ€™s algorithm.

```cmd
python3 main.py "(a & b) & (~c | (c & d & ~e))"
```
