### Problem Statement [ðŸ”—](https://app.simplenote.com/p/Pbbh5y)
Frank wants to throw a dinner party to celebrate Alice and Bobâ€™s engagement. He is also considering inviting their mutual friends Charles, Dave and Eve. However, he is aware that Charles will come to the party only if Dave comes without Eve. Frank wants to know what possible combinations of invitations he can write for his friends Alice, Bob, Charles, Dave and Eve.

Help Frank calculate all the possible combinations using Groverâ€™s algorithm.
